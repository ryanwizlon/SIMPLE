Based on the user's prompt, the shared dependencies between the files "index.html", "README.md", and ".gitignore" are minimal as these files serve different purposes and do not typically share variables, data schemas, id names, message names, or function names. 

However, there might be some shared aspects:

1. Project Name: The name of the project or the app might be shared across all three files. In "index.html", it might be used in the title or header tags. In "README.md", it would be used to describe the project. In ".gitignore", it doesn't directly appear but is indirectly related as it's the project's file.

2. Base URL: If there are any absolute paths used in the "index.html" file, the base URL (the GitHub Pages URL in this case) would be shared.

3. Common Directories and Files: Both "index.html" and ".gitignore" might reference common directories or files. For example, ".gitignore" might list directories or files that should not be tracked by Git, and these could also be referenced in "index.html".

4. Encoding Type: Both "index.html" and "README.md" might share the same text encoding type, typically UTF-8.

Please note that these are not typical "shared dependencies" in the sense of shared libraries or shared variables in a codebase, but they are shared aspects that might be common across these three files in the context of a GitHub Pages project.
